I took a part in the JS1024 contest last weekend.
The idea is to design and implement something interesting or valuable in 1024 bytes JS code.
I've done the *[Schulte Tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulte_table)* application.
*[Try it online](/projects/schulte-tables-js1024.html)*.
To have it as less size as possible,
I minimized the code by *[UglifyJS 3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-js)*.
There is *[online tool](https://skalman.github.io/UglifyJS-online/)*.

Happy coding!
