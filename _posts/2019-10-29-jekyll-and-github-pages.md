I don't remember when I started blogging. Probably 10-12 years ago.
I used several online systems. Last one was Wordpress.
It has several cons.:

- It's not easy to switch/jump from wordpress.com to another hosting.
- It's not easy to backup all posts/content as a set of source files/records.
- There are some limitations of layout and visual editor.
- It puts some ads right into my content. Generally, it's a cost of free hosting/service, but I don't like it anyway.

I don't need a lot of features, just regular posts publishing with SEO.
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) provides static blogging cases out of the box.
As [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) already provides Jekyll as a service, and even for free,
so, it looks like the best way.

I found simple theme and compose [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) project based on it.
Jekyll is the system to create and maintain static web sites.
It's implemented by ruby and has a lot of plugins as ruby gems.
Text content is composed and saved in source files. I use markdown format.
There is powerful styles and layout systems.
Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs:
  - Markdown for content
  - YAML for data
  - Liquid for templating
